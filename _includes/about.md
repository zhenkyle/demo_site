Jekyll is a static website generator developed in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). It has gained popularity especially since [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) provided native support for it. This does not mean you cannot use it without it, though. The main advantage of this is the ease of hosting.

As you probably well know even Mr. Obama used [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) during [his campaign](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/). In this guide I will show you how to develop your site or blog using Jekyll. Chant with me "Yes we Jekyll!". There we go.

> It is a good idea to go and [install Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) now unless you already have and get back right after that. Or you just might want to read on. Whatever suits your mojo.

The guide has actually been structured as a Jekyll site so feel free to explore the source. If you have any ideas on how to improve it, let me know at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bebraw/yeswejekyll/issues). Also [pull requests](https://github.com/bebraw/yeswejekyll/pulls) are appreciated.
